This code defines three classes: Product, ShoppingCartItem, and ShoppingCart. It includes methods to add and remove items from the cart, calculate the total price, and display the cart items. 
The testing section at the end demonstrates how to create products, add them to the cart, display the cart, remove an item, and then display the cart again.
